### Introduction
Some applications choose email confirmation as an additional step when signing up a new user.
This allows users to restore forgotten passwords and applications to protect from fake, spam
accounts. The task for this week’s laboratory work is to create an application that would
perform email confirmation.
You’ll first need to create an application that could register a new user. However, the
application must also require email confirmation (via a one time password / code or via a link).
After confirming their email, a user should be able to see that their email is confirmed.

### Laboratory Tasks
* Create an application that could register a new user;
* Perform email confirmation (via a one time password / code or via a link);
* Output on the screen whether a user confirmed their email or did not confirm it yet
